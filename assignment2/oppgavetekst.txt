Passing marks 65%
Task 1: Smart search bar (30%)
	•	Create a basic search bar that takes up 1/3 of the width of its container
	•	Add some padding so that the container is not sticking to the top left corner.
	•	Add some background colour.
	•	Add some styles now:
	•	Make sure the width is 1/3 when the bar is not in focus
	•	Give it some height
	•	Add border and border radius to make it look nice
	•	Add some colour to border as well
	•	When the user clicks in the search bar (hint: you have to use a pseudo class)
	•	Input grows to the entire width of its parent container
	•	Shrinks back to original size when user clicks away
	•	Blue border
Here is your basic HTML code that you will use for the search bar 
<body> 
        <div class="container">
          <input type="search" 
                class="search-bar" 
                id="search-field"
                placeholder="Search..."/>
        </div>
    </body>
Task 2: Target (10%)
(Hint: you will need to use box-radius, flex, justify and align)
Make the following with CSS only (the colours and their order are not important, you can choose your colours):

Task 3: Progress bar (20%)
Build a progress bar that you can change by changing the classes. Style a class for each of the following stages:
	•	Stage 1: 33% finished
	•	Stage 2: 67% finished
	•	Stage 3: 100% finished
Hint: think of the progress bar as three bars on top of one another and how you can use the width property.
Default progress bar:

Stage 1

Stage 2

Stage 3

Once again colours do not matter, also they do not have to be animated. 
Task 4: Playing cards (40%)
Hint: you have to use flex and grid for this task. Also think of transformations in CSS.
Keep the width of the cards 2/3 of their heights
Create the following cards try to match the design as closely as possible:

Here are the HTML that you will need
