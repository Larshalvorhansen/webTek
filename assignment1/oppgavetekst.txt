Passing percentage 65%
In this assignment, you will make a page to introduce yourself. You will use the elements that you have been studying in the lectures and some additional ones that are in the lecture slides. 
Part 1: Get started (45%)
Create a HTML file and name it about.html. This page will be a short introduction about you. Structure the document properly. Add the three elements header, section, and footer. In the header element, include an h1 heading element stating your names.

In the section element, first include a new header, an image and three paragraphs below the header. The paragraphs should contain the following:

	•	Your coding skills
	•	Your hobbies
In the header element within the section add an h2 heading tag containing the title "This is us".
Include the image between the heading and the first paragraph. It might be an image of anything. It can be a picture of you in a cape, or it can be a picture of something entirely different.
